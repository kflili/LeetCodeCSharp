### CHAPTER 1. ARRAY / STRING
**26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

**Description:**
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],  
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted**

**Description:**
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2

**242. Valid Anagram**

**Description:**
Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

For example,
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

**3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

**Description:**
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**28. Implement strStr()**

**Description:**
Implement strStr().

Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

**8. String to Integer (atoi)**

**Description:**
Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

### CHAPTER 2. LINKED LIST
**237. Delete Node in a Linked List**

**Description:**
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

**206. Reverse Linked List**

**Description:**
Reverse a singly linked list.

Hint:
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

**141. Linked List Cycle**

**Description:**
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

**21. Merge Two Sorted Lists**

**Description:**
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
